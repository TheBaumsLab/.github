The Baums Lab conducts fundamental and applied research as the basis for science based conservation and restoration strategies. Specifically, we combine ecological and evolutionary approaches to help us bridge the wide temporal and spatial scales characteristic of coral reef development. We envision a world where reef building corals persist through the current period of rapid climate change.
